	It was a cold morning in MistLand when suddenly a stranger pokes you with a stick
	waking you up from your deep slumber...
STRANGER: Welcome to Guar... *He says with a raspy voice*
STRANGER: You're new around here I assume... I only waked you up because you were sleeping in my stable
	and it does not look confortable, I suggest that if you want to sleep, you go to the Farsight Inn,
	it's north from here, there you can find Rest and Food in exchange for gold coins.
STRANGER: Oh, and welcome to GUAR...
